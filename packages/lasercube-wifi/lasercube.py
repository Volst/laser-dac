# The laser is listening on at least three UDP ports and responds to unicast
# and broadcast messages. This makes it possible to control multiple LaserCubes
# on the network individually or all as one (by sending messages to the
# broadcast address). However, controlling multiple cubes as one could make it
# trickier to manage backpressure (i.e. to keep track of how much buffer is
# free on each cube and adjust sending speed).
#
# Each port listens for and responds to different categories of messages, but
# the messages are in the same format.

# For "alive" messages (simple pings to check which lasers are on the network).
# This code currently just uses the GET_FULL_INFO command instead.
ALIVE_PORT = 45456

# For commands (get information from the laser, enable/disable output, set the
# ILDA point rate, etc.)
CMD_PORT = 45457

# For data, i.e. actual points to scan out with the laser.
DATA_PORT = 45458

# All commands are UDP messages where the first byte is the command ID and the
# remaining bytes (if any) are specific to the command. When sending data, be
# careful to keep each message small enough to fit inside the network's MTU;
# more on that below. Here are the commands used in this example:

# The laser responds with a bunch of status information; see below.
CMD_GET_FULL_INFO = 0x77

# Causes the laser to reply to data packets with the amount of free space left
# in the buffer.
CMD_ENABLE_BUFFER_SIZE_RESPONSE_ON_DATA = 0x78

# Enables/disables output. Second byte should be zero or one. In my experience,
# this doesn't actually disable output if you're still sending samples, but
# disabling output *is* necessary for the menu button on the back of the
# LaserCube to work.
CMD_SET_OUTPUT = 0x80

# The laser responds with a count of free space in the RX buffer.
CMD_GET_RINGBUFFER_EMPTY_SAMPLE_COUNT = 0x8a

# Sends a list of points to be scanned out. Must be sent to DATA_PORT. As far
# as I can tell, the second byte of the message is always 0x0, the third and
# fourth bytes are sequence numbers representing the message and frame, and the
# remainder of the message is a list of points. So, you can split a frame into
# as many messages as you want to stay within the network's MTU, but the
# sequence number needs to go up with each one (and wrap back to zero after
# 255). In other words, a message is structured like this:
#     { CMD_SAMPLE_DATA, 0x00, message_number, frame_number, x, y, r, g, b, x, y, r, g, b, ... }
# message_number should go up after every message and frame_number should go up
# after every complete "frame". Note: x, y, r, g, b are two bytes each, with a
# range of 0x0-0xfff (NOT 0x0-0xffff).
CMD_SAMPLE_DATA = 0xa9
